MailCannon Outpost
==================

Use this wrapper to deploy your [MailCannon](https://github.com/lucasmartins/mailcannon) workers to the war.

**This is a work in PROGRESS, use it at your own risk**

Install
=======

Refer to the [main gem for more details](https://github.com/lucasmartins/mailcannon).

[Download](https://github.com/lucasmartins/mailcannon-outpost/archive/master.zip) (or Clone/Fork) this repo, modify `env.sh` to meet your own variables and run it:
```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:lucasmartins/mailcannon-outpost.git
  $ cd mailcannon-outpost
  $ . ./env.sample.sh # this will create an env.sh file.
  $ vim env.sh
  $ . ./env.sh
```

You should be able to run the wrapper like this:

```bash
  $ be sidekiq -r ./runner.rb --config=config/sidekiq.yml -v
```

You can access a console with MailCannon environment loaded like this:
```bash
  $ irb -r ./runner.rb
```

or like this on Heroku:
```bash
  $ heroku run 'bundle exec irb -r ./runner.rb'
```

MailCannon Outpost will use your `MONGOBD_URL`, take a look at your `config/mongoid.yml` file.

Use
===

Create a `MailCannon::Envelope`:
```ruby
envelope = MailCannon::Envelope.create(
  from: 'test@mailcannon.com',
  to: [{email: 'lucasmartins@railsnapraia.com', name: 'Lucas Martins'}],
  subject: 'Test',
  mail: MailCannon::Mail.new(text: 'you will see this when no HTML reader is available', html: 'this should be an HTML'))
```

Auto-scaling
============

MailCannon Outpost has support for [Hirefire](http://hirefireapp.com) (if you don't know it yet I strongly recommend you to check it out), you can also use Outpost's endpoint to implement your own auto-scaling.

The endpoint will try to use - if available - the environment variable `HIREFIRE_TOKEN`, if that's not the case, it will fallback to development mode:

`curl http://my-mailcannon.com/hirefire/my_awesome_hirefire_token/info`

`curl http://localhost:3000/hirefire/development/info`

The 'info' endpoint will return a JSON with the following structure:

```json
[{"name":"worker", "quantity":0}]
```

Where **0** is the count of how many jobs are running right now.

In the future, this structure might change to accomodate more types of jobs - so there will be more hashes inside the array, with other names so you can scale it separately.

Caveats
=======

MongoDB isn't an ACID database, you should be aware of [MongoDB fundamentals](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/faq/fundamentals/#does-mongodb-support-transactions) (read the docs!) to put any app into production.

So **depending** on your setup, you **may** want to use [synced operations](http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/persistence.html#atomic) to write your Envelopes to the database:
```ruby
envelope = MailCannon::Envelope.with(safe: {j: true}).create(...)
```

Also, depending on your load, you may want to increase the `waiting_time` variable in your `config/mailcannon.yml` file to match your `fsync` cycle.
